                <p>
                    The tallest twin towers in the world, the Petronas reach an impressive 452 meters high up into the clouds. 
                    The towers are 88 floors tall and have an impressive total of 76 elevators.
                    <br><br>
                    Built using reinforced concrete, steel, and glass, the two towers are connected to each other by a double skybridge on the 41st and 42nd floors. 
                    Visitors can make their way up here for stunning views of KL and the 6.9-hectare KLCC Park below—the views are particularly impressive at night.
                    <br><br>
                    While most of the floors on the towers are rented to companies—IBM, Microsoft, and Huawei Technologies all have offices here—the bottom floors 
                    of the towers are reserved for Suria KLCC, one of the largest shopping centers in Malaysia. With over 300 stores, an art gallery, and even space 
                    for a Philharmonic Hall, this retail and entertainment space will keep visitors occupied for hours.

                    Malaysia is a country blessed with beautiful natural beaches and islands, as she is made up of a large peninsular and the third 
                    largest island in the world.
                    <br><br>
                    As Malaysia has a long history of civilisation and colonialisation, you can find traces of Portuguese, Dutch, English 
                    and Japanese architectural and cultural heritage in Malaysia.
                    <br><br>
                    You must also visit Malaysia if you want to taste different kinds of oriental cuisine because here in Malaysia we 
                    have Malay, Chinese, Indian and a lot of other types of cuisines.
                    <br><br>
                    Malaysia is also a must-visit place for those who want see different culture and religious practices in a harmonious 
                    community. We have some of the most beautiful mosques, largest Hindu temple complex and several gigantic Buddha monuments.

                <h1>Kek Lok Si Temple</h1>

                <p>
                    Malaysia's largest Buddhist temple sits on a hill, at the bottom of Air Itam mountain. As Asian temples go, Kek Lok Si 
                    is relatively new, as construction began in 1890—but the massive seven-story Pagoda surrounded by 10,000 Buddha statues 
                    make this a striking destination that can't be missed.
                    <br><br>
                    Surrounded by gardens, fish ponds, prayer halls, and a number of stalls selling both religious and secular souvenirs, 
                    the pagoda is also home to a 36-meter-tall statue of Kwan Yin, the Buddhist goddess of mercy.
                    <br><br>
                    The temple attracts many visitors from all around Southeast Asia who come here to "make merits" but also to see one of 
                    the most important pilgrimage sites in the area. Chinese New Year celebrations are particularly beautiful at the temple, 
                    as the entire space is decorated with thousands of lanterns.
