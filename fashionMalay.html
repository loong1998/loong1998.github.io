                <h2>Malay Traditional Clothing</h2>

                <p>
                    The Baju Kurung is a conventional Malay ensemble dating back from the fifteenth century, which approximately interpreted 
                    signifies "encased dress". Despite the fact that Baju Kurung is the name for the clothing for the two people, in 
                    Malaysia, the female dress is alluded to as Baju Kurung, while the male dress is alluded to as Baju Melayu. 
                    <br><br>
                    This sort of ensemble is the public dress of Brunei and Malaysia. In Indonesia, it is one of the numerous local 
                    dresses of this socially and ethnically different country (it is discovered particularly on the island of 
                    Sumatra – where numerous ethnic Malays and Minangkabau ladies wear it). It can likewise be found in Singapore and 
                    Thailand.

                <h1>Female Clothing</h1>

                <p>
                    Before Islam became popular in Malaysia, local women wore sarongs tied just above the chest – they were called “kemban”. 
                    Later, Malay females replaced the kemban with more modest garments: a knee-length blouse, a long skirt, and a scarf or 
                    shawl. The blouse is called “baju kurung”, the skirt is called “kain”. The shawl – sarong – is colorful and bright. 
                    There are several ways of draping the sarong depending on the outfit and the needs of a woman at the moment. 
                    For example, the sarong can be used as a baby sling – the name of this shawl is “selendang”. 
                    When sarong is worn as a headscarf (it is called “tudung” or “tudong”), it covers the hair, neck, and ears. 
                    The face is left open. In Malaysia, tudung is a formal headdress used in offices, schools, other institutions, and also, 
                    for the formal occasions.

                <h1>Male Clothing</h1>

                <p>
                    Malay men wear a loose tunic, trousers, a sarong wrapped around the hips, and a headdress. 
                    The tunic is called “baju melayu”. The sarong is called “sampin”; its ends are sewn together. 
                    Malay male outfits are usually made from bright-colored cotton or silk.
                    <br><br>
                    As a headdress, a cap called “songkok” is used (it has a shape of a truncated cone). 
                    Another popular Malay headdress is called “tanjak” or “tengkolok”. It is made from a long songket cloth 
                    (traditional Malay handwoven fabric with gold or silver threads) folded and tied in a special shape.
